## ColorfulWords
### This program uses regular expressions to parse the macOS built-in dictionary and save words using only A-F (words possible in hexidecimal), then builds a website to showcase those possible colors

* BuildDictionary.java examines the dictionary and builds possible hexidecimal values to be used
* BuildSite.java turns those words into the site
* ColorfulSite.html and ColorfulStyles.css comprise the stating site, and FullColorfulSite.html is that site with the color divs added
