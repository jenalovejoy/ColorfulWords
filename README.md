## ColorfulWords
### This program uses regular expressions to parse the macOS built-in dictionary and save words using only A-F (words possible in hexidecimal), then builds a website to showcase those possible colors

* Dictionary.txt contains all English words, which FindHexWords.java pares down into AllHexWords.txt
* ColorfulSite.html and ColorfulStyles.css build the site
* index.js creates the server and conncets the files
* ColorfulWords.js populates the website with the colors
